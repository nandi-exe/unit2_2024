# Unit 2: A Distributed Weather Station for ISAK

## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Our client, Mr. X, a student at an international school in Karuizawa, is an avid coffee collector who values the rich aroma and flavor of premium coffee beans. However, he has grown increasingly concerned about the potential impact of humidity on the quality of his carefully curated collection. Fluctuating humidity levels in his pantry may lead to issues such as moisture absorption, mold growth, or a loss of freshness, all of which can compromise the beans' quality. Ensuring the optimal storage conditions for his coffee has become a priority for Mr. X as he strives to preserve the distinct characteristics of his beans.

## Proposed Solution
Considering the client requirements an adequate solution includes a low cost sensing device for humidity and temperature and a custom data script that process and anaysis the samples acquired. For a low cost sensing device an adequate alternative is the DHT11 sensor[^1] which is offered online for less than 5 USD and provides adequare precision and range for the client requirements (Temperature Range: 0°C to 50°C, Humidity Range: 20% to 90%). Similar devices such as the DHT22, AHT20 or the AM2301B [^2] have higher specifications, however the DHT11 uses a simple serial communication (SPI) rather than more eleborated protocols such as the I2C used by the alternatives. For the range, precision and accuracy required in this applicaiton the DHT11 provides the best compromise. Connecting the DHT11 sensor to a computer requires a device that provides a Serial Port communication. A cheap and often used alternative for prototyping is the Arduino UNO microcontroller [^3]. "Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software"[^4]. In additon to the low cost of the Arduino (< 6USD), this devide is programable and expandable[^1]. I considered alternatives such diffeerent versions of the original Arduino but their size and price make them a less adequate solution.

Considering the budgetary constrains of the client and the hardware requirements, the software tool that I proposed for this solution is Python. Python's open-source nature and platform independence contribute to the long-term viability of the system. The use of Python simplifies potential future enhancements or modifications, allowing for seamless scalability without the need for extensive redevelopment [^5][^6]. In comparison to the alternative C or C++, which share similar features, Python is a High level programming language (HLL) with high abstraction [^7]. For example, memory management is automatic in Python whereas it is responsability of the C/C++ developer to allocate and free up memory [^7], this could result in faster applications but also memory problems. In addition a HLL language will allow me and future developers extend the solution or solve issues proptly.
