# Unit 2: A Distributed Weather Station for ISAK

## Criteria A: Planning

### Problem Definition
Our client, Mr. X, a boarding student at a local international school, is an avid coffee collector who values the rich aroma and flavor of premium coffee beans. However, he has grown increasingly concerned about the potential impact of humidity on the quality of his carefully curated collection. Fluctuating humidity levels in his pantry may lead to issues such as moisture absorption, mold growth, or a loss of freshness, all of which can compromise the beans' quality. Mr. X has already encountered some problems with declining bean quality. Ensuring the optimal storage conditions for his coffee has become a priority for Mr. X as he strives to preserve the distinct characteristics of his beans.

### Proposed Solution

To address the client’s requirements, a cost-effective and scalable solution includes a low-cost sensing device for humidity and temperature, combined with a custom data processing script for analyzing the acquired samples. For the sensing device, an excellent choice is the DHT11 [[1]](https://www.adafruit.com/product/386) [[2]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/366522967_An_Approach_for_Implementing_Innovative_Weather_Monitoring_System_with_DHT11_Sensor_and_Arduino_Uno_Tool_based_on_IoT) [[3]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350859817_Automatic_Room_Temperature_Control_System_Using_Arduino_UNO_R3_and_DHT11_Sensor) sensor, which is available for less than $5 and provides adequate precision and range for the application (Temperature Range: 0°C to 50°C, Humidity Range: 20% to 90%). While alternatives like the DHT22, AHT20, or AM2301B offer higher specifications, the DHT11’s simplicity, using SPI communication instead of more complex protocols like I2C, makes it a better fit for this application.

To interface the DHT11 sensor with a computational platform, we proposed using a Raspberry Pi instead of an Arduino. The Raspberry Pi, starting at around $10 for the Raspberry Pi Zero, is a versatile, low-cost computer [[4]](https://ijece.iaescore.com/index.php/IJECE/article/view/27879) that includes GPIO pins for direct sensor interfacing and runs a full operating system. Unlike the Arduino, which requires an additional computer to run the data processing software, the Raspberry Pi can both collect data and run the required Python scripts, consolidating the hardware into a single device. Its flexibility and computing power also make it easier to integrate additional functionalities, such as remote monitoring or cloud storage, should the client’s needs evolve.

Considering the budgetary constraints and system requirements, the proposed software tool for this solution is Python. Python's open-source nature, platform independence, and extensive library support [[5]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0686-2) [[6]](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/) make it ideal for data analysis and visualization tasks. The language’s high abstraction level simplifies development and maintenance compared to lower-level alternatives like C or C++ [[7]](https://realpython.com/python-vs-cpp/#memory-management). Python’s automatic memory management and vast ecosystem of libraries ensure efficient development and seamless scalability for future enhancements [[8]](https://github.com/tino/pyFirmata) [[9]](https://pythongeeks.org/advantages-disadvantages-of-python/). By leveraging Python on a Raspberry Pi, the system achieves a balance of simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and flexibility to meet the client’s needs.

### Design Statement
To address Mr. X's concerns about the impact of fluctuating humidity on his coffee bean collection, we aim to design a cost-effective and user-friendly system that monitors and maintains optimal storage conditions. The system will leverage the DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity measurements, integrated with a Raspberry Pi for data collection and processing. Python will be employed for data analysis, visualization, and potential predictive modeling. The solution will include a local storage system for continuous monitoring and a scalable framework for future enhancements, such as remote data access or cloud integration. This system will ensure precise and reliable tracking of environmental conditions, empowering Mr. X to preserve the quality and freshness of his premium coffee beans effectively.

### Success Criteria

6. The solution provides a prediction for the subsequent 12 hours for Humidity, Temperature and atmospheric pressure (HL).
[Issue tackled]: Assists Mr. X in preemptive action against potential environmental changes that could harm his coffee bean collection.
7. The solution includes a poster summarizing the visual representations, model and analysis created. The poster includes a recommendation about healthy levels for Humidity, Temperature and atmospheric pressure (HL). 
[Issue tackled]: Offers a clear and accessible summary of findings and helpful recommendations, empowering Mr. X to implement effective storage strategies.

### How is the data stored and managed?
The collected data is stored locally in a CSV file for structured access and offline analysis. This format allows for easy reading, modification, and integration with data-processing tools. To ensure data persistence and accessibility, the CSV data is periodically uploaded to an API server. This two-tiered approach balances local storage for quick access with remote storage for backup and broader analysis, providing a reliable and scalable system for managing the collected environmental data.

### Data Collection and Sorting: Success Criteria 1 & 3 (Remote part)
Server sensors can sometimes experience downtime or inconsistencies, leading to missing or irregular readings. To ensure data accuracy and reliability, we need to identify a continuous 48-hour period (2880 readings) where data is complete and consistent. Step 3,4, and 5 allows us to filter out unreliable data and focus on analyzing high-quality, uninterrupted information based on previous sensor readings.

#### Code Breakdown
**Part 1: Data Collection and Organization
Step 1: Fetch Data from Server**
```.py
import requests
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime

# Define the server IP to fetch data from
server_ip = "192.168.4.137"  # Server IP

# Send a GET request to fetch sensor readings
response = requests.get(f"http://{server_ip}/readings")

# Parse JSON response into Python dictionary
data = response.json()
readings = data["readings"][0]
```
**What it does: Sends a request to the server to fetch JSON data. The first set of readings is extracted for further processing.
Step 2: Organize Data by Sensor Type**
```.py
# Initialize lists for different sensor types
temperature_data = []
humidity_data = []
pressure_data = []

# Loop through each reading and separate by sensor type
for r in readings:
    timestamp = datetime.fromisoformat(r["datetime"])  # Convert ISO timestamp to datetime
    if r["sensor_id"] == 11:  # Temperature sensor
        temperature_data.append((timestamp, r["value"]))
    elif r["sensor_id"] == 10:  # Humidity sensor
        humidity_data.append((timestamp, r["value"]))
    elif r["sensor_id"] == 12:  # Pressure sensor
        pressure_data.append((timestamp, r["value"]))
```
**Purpose: Classifies sensor readings (temperature, humidity, pressure) into separate lists, tagging each reading with its timestamp.
****Step 3: Sort Data Chronologically**
```.py
# Sort readings for each sensor type by timestamp
temperature_data.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
humidity_data.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
pressure_data.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
```
**Why: Time-series data needs to be in order for accurate analysis and modeling.
Step 4: Ensure Consecutive Data Quality**
```.py
# Minimum required readings for 48 hours (1 reading per minute)
min_required = 2880

def find_last_consecutive(data, required_count):
    """
    Finds the last block of consecutive readings of the required count.
    Ensures each reading is exactly 1 minute apart.
    """
    for i in range(len(data) - required_count, -1, -1):
        timestamps_block = [data[j][0] for j in range(i, i + required_count)]
        # Check if all timestamps are 1 minute apart
        if all((timestamps_block[j + 1] - timestamps_block[j]).seconds == 60 for j in range(len(timestamps_block) - 1)):
            return data[i : i + required_count]
    return []
```
**Why: Validates data integrity by ensuring each block of readings has no gaps.
Step 5: Apply Consecutive Check**
```.py
# Extract last block of 2880 consecutive readings for each sensor
temperature_consecutive = find_last_consecutive(temperature_data, min_required)
humidity_consecutive = find_last_consecutive(humidity_data, min_required)
pressure_consecutive = find_last_consecutive(pressure_data, min_required)

# Handle insufficient data
if not temperature_consecutive or not humidity_consecutive or not pressure_consecutive:
    print("Error: Not enough consecutive data for one or more sensors.")
    exit()
```
**What it does: Ensures all sensors have enough valid data for analysis.
Step 6: Extract and Separate Values**
```.py
# Extract timestamps and sensor values from consecutive readings
timestamps = [t[0] for t in temperature_consecutive]
temperatures = [t[1] for t in temperature_consecutive]
humidities = [h[1] for h in humidity_consecutive]
pressures = [p[1] for p in pressure_consecutive]
```
**Purpose: Prepares time-series data for modeling by separating timestamps and sensor values.
**#### Part 2: Mathematical Modeling and Visualization
**Step 1: Convert Time to Minutes**
**
```.py
# Convert timestamps to "minutes since start"
start_time = timestamps[0]
time_minutes = [(t - start_time).total_seconds() / 60 for t in timestamps]
```
**Why: Simplifies time representation for fitting mathematical models.
Step 2: Define Models**
```.py
def sine_model(x, A, B, C, D):
    """Sine function for periodic data (e.g., temperature, humidity)."""
    return A * np.sin(B * x + C) + D

def poly_model(x, a, b, c):
    """Quadratic polynomial for non-periodic data (e.g., pressure)."""
    return a * x**2 + b * x + c
```
**Models Used:
Sine: Captures periodic fluctuations (e.g., day-night temperature cycles).
Polynomial: Models trends in non-periodic data (e.g., pressure).
Step 3: Fit Models to Data**
```.py
# Fit models to sensor data
temp_params, _ = curve_fit(sine_model, time_minutes, temperatures, p0=[3, 0.003, 0, 26])
humidity_params, _ = curve_fit(sine_model, time_minutes, humidities, p0=[2, 0.003, 0, 16])
pressure_params, _ = curve_fit(poly_model, time_minutes, pressures)
```
**What it does: Finds optimal parameters for each model using curve fitting.
Step 4: Generate Predictions**
```.py
# Generate predictions using the fitted models
time_fit = np.linspace(0, max(time_minutes), 1000)  # Smoother time points
temp_fit = sine_model(time_fit, *temp_params)
humidity_fit = sine_model(time_fit, *humidity_params)
pressure_fit = poly_model(time_fit, *pressure_params)
```
**Why: Creates smooth curves for visual comparison against raw data.
Step 5: Plot Data and Models**
```.py
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))

# Temperature plot
plt.subplot(3, 1, 1)
plt.plot(time_minutes, temperatures, color="red", label="Data")
plt.plot(time_fit, temp_fit, color="blue", label="Sine Model Fit")
plt.title("Temperature Model")
plt.legend()
plt.grid()

# Humidity plot
plt.subplot(3, 1, 2)
plt.plot(time_minutes, humidities, color="blue", label="Data")
plt.plot(time_fit, humidity_fit, color="green", label="Sine Model Fit")
plt.title("Humidity Model")
plt.legend()
plt.grid()

# Pressure plot
plt.subplot(3, 1, 3)
plt.plot(time_minutes, pressures, color="green", label="Data")
plt.plot(time_fit, pressure_fit, color="purple", label="Polynomial Model Fit")
plt.title("Pressure Model")
plt.legend()
plt.grid()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
**What it does: Visualizes raw data and fitted models in subplots for comparison.

Conclusion**
This script ensures data integrity, fits appropriate models to sensor readings, and visualizes the data effectively.
